Hey guys, I've been working on a build creator site for MHW in my spare time over the past few weeks, and it's finally at the point that I'm ready to share it and start getting some feedback. It's still far from complete, but it's at least starting to feel like it could be useful to some people.

All the item and skill data entry has been by far the most time consuming part, and it's still missing a ton of items, but most of the rarity 6-8 armor and end-of-tree weapons are there. Also, keep in mind that all the data there has been entered by hand using references from in-game, kirikano and the wiki so there's bound to be some mistakes - let me know if you notice any.

Missing features / To do in very rough priority order:
- Weapon augments
- Armor augments/upgrading
- Detailed bowgun stats
- Kinsects and bowgun mods
- Show more bonuses from skills such as stamina recovery, crit boost percentage, health/stamina boost, etc.
- Show more theoretical stat information.
- Finish high rank armor data entry.
- Make things prettier.
- Probably lots of other things that I'm forgetting right now.
